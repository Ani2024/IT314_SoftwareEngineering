# Q1 : Functional and Non Functional requirements of the Library Information System (LIS) for the benefit of students and employees of the institute.
## Functional requirements:
The fucntional requirements will be based on the need of the user as well as the Librarian.</br>
-> The librarian can enter a new record into the system when a new book has been purchased, or remove a record in case any book is
taken off the shelf.</br>
-> The Librarian can add a new member or delete the existing member.</br>
-> A login page for the user.</br>
-> The user can search for the book on the basis of the date of publication, author name and the type of the book.</br>
-> The library information system should set a reminder for the returning of the book. In case the it is overdue it should remind the librarian as well as the user and needed charge has to be taken.</br>
-> The LIS system should store the data of the books issued, return along with the time stamp and the availabality of the books in the shelf.</br>
-> User must be authenticated while login into the portal of the library. </br>
-> There should be a separate panel for the user for suggesting a book to be buy if not available in the library.</br>

## Non Functional requirements:
The non functional requirements are based on how the system, that has been developed,should performed. </br>
* **Security** : </br>
  The librarian can have the access of the updating, adding and deleting the data or records of the book, which should not be given to the user.</br>
  The 2 step verification process should be provided in case of any malfunction.</br>
* **Login Page** : </br>
  The LIS system should developed a proper login page for the ease of login for both the user as well as the librarian.</br>
  A application like webapp can be developed which allows user to search for the book without entering the details in system of library.</br>
* **Availability** : <br/>
  The LIS system should be available for all the time, even if there is any problem arises in the network of the system. </br>
  It should be available 24x7 on webapp. </br>
* Hardware Constraint : </br>
  There should be a server for storing the database of all the working days. </br>
  The user must have a device for accessing the book infoarmation.</br>
  The database must have backup capabilities.</br>
  
  
  
# Q2 : Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects for the people having partial deafness.</br>

## Fnctional requirements :
->  User should able to sense the objects by custom pattern of vibrations which user will decide on its own like different vibrations pattern for carn horn and baby.</br>

-> If any object comes very close to the user then the frequency of vibration should increase.</br>
-> There should be a username password, google and facebook authentication.</br>
->  User should be able to make a new account by adding its own custom username and password.</br>
